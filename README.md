# Project-Tracker
Every organization either big or small, has summons to overbear and regulate the  information on project assignment, its strategic planning, its development status etc. Its  very important for any organization to have an eye on projects which are being developed  under various teams and to initiate proper steps to finish the project within allocated time.  The existing manual system is not capable of providing alerts on deadlines for the works  which needed to be completed within their specified time space. Thereby to attack and  solve this problem we propose this project Project Tracker which will track the  information on all ongoing new projects and maintain the status of each record at various  phases. The project allows the manager to assign projects to different departments and  can set the deadlines for termination of projects. It helps to track the time invested in  completion of different levels of projects and can be a reference for future use. The  application helps to know the status of ongoing projects.
